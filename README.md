A security-focused mobile fitness tracking app built with React Native and Flask.

**Goals:**

- Run as a native iOS/Android app
- Suggest workouts for undertrained muscles based on history
- Provide data visualizations (progress over time)
- Follow basic mobile security expectations (JWT auth, encryption, etc.)

**Status:** Planning / In active development
